# Age-Prediction-and-Gender-Detection

# Objective:
1. Guess a person’s age from a photo of their face.
2. Identify if the person is male or female based on the same image.

# Steps:

1. Collecting Data
   - First, we gather a large number of pictures of people’s faces, where the age and gender of each person is already known. These images help the system learn patterns in faces.

2. Preparing the Data
   - Before using the images, we clean and prepare them. This involves detecting and cropping only the face area and adjusting the image size so that they are consistent for the model to learn from.

3. Training the Model
   - We use machine learning techniques to teach the computer to recognize patterns. By feeding it thousands of images, the model learns to associate certain facial features with specific age ranges and gender.

4. Making Predictions
   - Once trained, the model can take a new image of a person’s face and predict their age and gender by analyzing the features like facial structure, wrinkles, and other characteristics.
